# Class - ARRAY
A C++ **class** that permits an easy manipulation of an **Array**.

Limits: the **Array** has a fixed amount of cells for the moment, 100000; so you can operate between 1 and 1000000 cells.

Methods:
Here is a list of all the methods that you can use within this class


**Help**          ()             = Prints the all the methods on the road

**Print**          ()             = Prints the Array

**Mirror**       ()             = Mirrors the Array

**Sort**           ()             = Sorts the Array (Merge Sort)

**Research**   (int key) = Researches a number in the Array



**pushBack**  (int x)   = Inserts new numbers from the last cell of the Array

**pushFront** (int x)   = Inserts new numbers from the first cell of the Array

**popBack**    (int x)   = Deletes the last element in the last cell of the Array

**popFront**   (int x)   = Deletes the first element in the first cell of the Array



**getMinimum**     ()        = Gets the minimum number in the Array

**getAverage**       ()        = Calculates the average number of the Array

**getSum**              ()        = Calculates the sum of the numbers in the Array

**getSize**               ()        = Gets the current size of the Array


**spaceControl()** = Gets the current physical sized occupied by the Array;


**extractMinimum** ()  = Exctracts the minimum number in the array and deletes it


**setSize** (int M)   = Sets the size of the Array
